# 2nd Year Project
# Event Management with Java

<p>
This project is a Java program that can create, delete, update, read entries into a database.<br>
It works similar as the Event Management System Website's backend on managing events and locations.

*I'm still trying to figure out how to make this project work on a localhost (port 8080 at home)s ince we were using<br>
this project with the server 'daneel' for the database.
